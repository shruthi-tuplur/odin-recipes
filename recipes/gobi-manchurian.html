    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Gobi manchurian has been one of my all time favorite foods for years. As a South Asian, this yummy, crispy, fried cauliflower is my go-to whenever I get North Indian food, but it can sometimes
        be hard to find restaurants that have it. But even then, as yummy as it can be at a restaurant, it still lacks that home cooked-ness that adds that special touch.
    </p>
    <p> My family tends to make this recipe in the air fryer, but it's definitely possible to pan-fry it as well. Either way, be careful after frying the cauliflowers because
        when they're freshly fried, they're extremely yummy and you might end up eating them all before you even get a chance to add the crucial Manchurian sauce that makes 
        this recipe so special. You have been warned.

    <h3> <em> Steps </em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> To make the sauce, heat the oil in a skillet on high heat. Once hot, add the grated garlic, ginger, green chili and chopped celery.
            Saute for 1 minute until ginger-garlic start changing color.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Then add the chopped onion, green pepper and scallions. Cook for high heat for around 3 minutes.</p></li> 
        <li> Then add the soy sauce, ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce (like sriracha), sugar and white pepper powder. Taste test and add salt if needed. Set aside.</li>     
        <li> <p> Meanwhile cut and clean cauliflower florets and drop them in hot salted water. Simmer on medium heat for around 4 minutes. Drain water and place florets on a paper tissue. Pat dry each individually.</p></li>   
        <li> To a large bowl, add the flour, cornstarch, ginger-garlic paste, salt and pepper. Whisk and start adding water, little by little.
            Form a smooth, free-flowing batter. It should not be too thick or thin.</li>     
        <li> <p> Heat oil for frying on medium heat in a pan. Once oil is hot, dip the florets into the batter. Make sure they are well coated with the batter.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Drain off the excess batter and carefully drop florets into the hot oil.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Fry on medium heat for 6 to 7 minutes, until crispy and browned..</p></li>
        <li> <p> Transfer the fried cauliflower florets into the sauce (sauce should be warm when you do this).
            Toss to combine until all the florets are well coated with the sauce.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Garnish with scallions and serve gobi manchurian with hakka noodles or enjoy as it is!</p></li>
