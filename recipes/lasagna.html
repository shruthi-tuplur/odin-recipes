    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> There's nothing quite like an ooey, gooey lasagna so fresh out of mom's oven it burns your tongue. Well, I can't promise you mom's
        lasagna, but this recipe will definitely rival it. </p>
    
    <p> I came up with this recipe on a cold and rainy Sunday afternoon years ago, when the kids wanted something warm and cheesy for supper. 
        Remembering the way my <em>nonna</em> made her lasagna using a special ingredient included in this recipe, I threw together
        what is <em>still</em> the meal my kids beg me for when they're home visiting from college! </p>  
        
    <h3> <em>Necessary ingredients</em></h3>    
    <ul>
        <li> 1 lb sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li> 3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li> 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li> 2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste </li>
        <li> 2 (6.5 oz) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup water </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li> 1.5 tsp dried basil leaves </li>
        <li> 0.5 tsp funnel seeds </li>
        <li> 1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li> 1.5 tsp salt (to taste) </li>
        <li> 0.25 tsp ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 4 tbsp chopped fresh parley </li>
        <li> 12 lasagna noodles </li>
        <li> 16 ounces ricotta cheese </li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> 3/4 lb mozzarella cheese, sliced </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <em> Steps </em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
             Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, 
             Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
             stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 
            1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li> 
        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>     
        <li> <p> To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise 
            over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 
            1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure 
            the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>   
        <li> Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
