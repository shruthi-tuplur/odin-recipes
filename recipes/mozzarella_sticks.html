    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Mozzarella sticks are everybody's favorite. They're the perfect recipe for those chaotic evenings where you have a presentation due at midnight
        for work and your husband Steve said he would take care of dinner but he burnt the frozen pizza he put in the oven and you
        have to <em>scramble</em> to get dinner taken care of because it's 9pm and the kids won't stop crying. </p>
    
    <p> This recipe is also the perfect meal for the days when you're exhausted from being an adult and just want to feel like a kid again
        (at least for the 30 seconds it takes you to wolf down the mozzarella sticks you just made), but not too much like a kid so
        you decide to make them from scratch instead of the $3.00 box of frozen mozzarella sticks you usually get from Target. The cheese pull on these sticks
        rival that of the mozzarella sticks you usually get at Denny's, but they're homemade so they're slightly healthier!! </p>    
        
    <h3> Here are the ingredients you will need:</h3>
    <h4> <em> note: the recommended serving size for this recipe is 1 stick, but we
              all know you won't be stopping after 1.</em></h4>    

    <ul>
        <li> oil for frying</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup water </li>
        <li> 1 cup Italian breadcrumbs </li>
        <li> 12 mozzarella cheese sticks </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3> <em> Steps </em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> Add 2-3 inches of oil to a deep-frying pan or pot and heat it over medium heat or until it reaches 265 degrees Fahrenheit.</p></li>
        <li> <p> In the meantime, add the flour to a shallow bowl then add the salt and pepper and stir to combine.</p></li> 
        <li> In another shallow bowl, whisk the eggs and water together.</li>     
        <li> <p> Finally, in a separate shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs.</p></li>   
        <li> Dredge the cheese sticks one at a time in the flour then dip them in the egg mixture then coat them in the breadcrumbs and set them on a plate or cooling rack.</li>     
        <li> <p> Once the oil is ready, fry each of the cheese sticks in the oil for 2-3 minutes or until light and golden. Only add 3-4 cheese sticks at a time to not overcrowd the pan.</p></li>
        <li> <p> Let them cool on a cooling rack or a plate fitted with a paper towel then serve with marinara sauce.</p></li>
        <li> <strong> EAT !!!! </strong> I suggest dipping them in either marinara sauce or with ranch.</li>
    </ol>
